## GPU Ray Tracer

This project is a GPU Ray Tracer written in C and OpenCL.
The [kernel](https://github.com/alexgeek/gpu-raytracer/blob/master/kernels/trace.cl)
does the actual per-pixel ray tracing.

This project is a pain to compile, I recommend Nvidia's GPU compute toolkit for
the relevant OpenCL libraries.
